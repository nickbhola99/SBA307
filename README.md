# SBA 307
For the SBA 307, I have created a website for a cinema called The Plex with HTML and CSS.
## Features
This website is made up of three pages: a landing page that also acts as the home page, a sign up page, and a page showing movies that are currently playing. For the project, the website behaves as if the year is 2003 and displays movies that released from October through December. 
Examples of tags used were ul to make the navbar, a href to link every page together, ,form and label for the sign up page, and table tags to display movies currently plalying. Inherent, Inline, and External styling were all used to style every page. Each page had its own CSS file, every page linked to the landing page's CSS file as well because it contained the styling for the navbar.
